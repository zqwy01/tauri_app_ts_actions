# Me tauri app

What is this app trying to accomplish?

- Absolutely nothing;
- Absolutely nothing again;
- And, of course, dissapointment;

# 01.04.2023
The first actual update!

- Added support for multiple peeps to be added at once before being flushed
- The application actually builds (wow)
- Added TypeScript code so unsafe not even a sandbox can save your PC!
